## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S linux-headers base-devel alsa-lib

# Fedora
sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers @development-tools dkms alsa-lib-devel

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential libasound2t64
```

**Note**: The ALSA libraries are required for the mute button LED control feature. The driver will still compile without them, but LED sync functionality will be disabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We've noticed issues when using this driver at the same time with *`hp_wmi`* loaded. Since we implement the same things but in an improved way, there's no reason to keep both fighting each other for WMI events (which **will** cause issues)
> ```bash
> sudo modprobe -r hp_wmi
> echo "blacklist hp_wmi" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-hp.conf
> #regenerate your initramfs (dependent on your distro)
> ```

### Build and Install
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alessandromrc/omen-rgb-keyboard.git
cd omen-rgb-keyboard

# Build and install
sudo make install
```

The module will be built and installed using DKMS, which will automatically rebuild it on kernel updates.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to manually interact with DKMS, remember that the DKMS module name uses hyphens (`omen-rgb-keyboard`), while the loaded kernel module uses underscores (`omen_rgb_keyboard`).

### Automatic Loading on Boot
The driver is configured to load automatically on boot. If you need to set this up manually:

```bash
# Create modprobe configuration (for module options)
sudo cp omen_rgb_keyboard.conf /etc/modprobe.d/

# Create systemd module loading configuration
echo "omen_rgb_keyboard" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/omen_rgb_keyboard.conf

# Create state directory
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/omen-rgb-keyboard
```

Alternatively, use the provided installation script:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### Non-Root Access (Optional)

By default, controlling the RGB keyboard requires sudo privileges. To allow your user to control the RGB keyboard without sudo:

```bash
# Install udev rules and configure user permissions
sudo ./install-udev-rules.sh
```

This script will:
- Install udev rules that grant access to users in the 'input' group
- Add your user to the 'input' group automatically
- Reload udev rules to apply changes immediately

**Important:** After running this script, you need to log out and log back in (or run `newgrp input`) for the group membership to take effect.

After installation, you can control the keyboard without sudo:
```bash
# No sudo needed!
echo "rainbow" | tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/animation_mode
echo "5" | tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/animation_speed
```

## Usage

### Loading the Module
```bash
# Load the module
sudo modprobe omen_rgb_keyboard

# Check if it loaded successfully
lsmod | grep omen_rgb_keyboard
```

### Controlling RGB Lighting

The driver creates sysfs attributes in `/sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/`:

#### Individual Zone Control
```bash
# Set zone 0 to red
echo "FF0000" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/zone00

# Set zone 1 to green
echo "00FF00" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/zone01

# Set zone 2 to blue
echo "0000FF" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/zone02

# Set zone 3 to purple
echo "FF00FF" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/zone03
```

#### All-Zone Control
```bash
# Set all zones to the same color
echo "FFFFFF" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/all
```

#### Brightness Control
```bash
# Set brightness to 50%
echo "50" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/brightness

# Set brightness to 100% (maximum)
echo "100" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/brightness

# Turn off lighting (0% brightness)
echo "0" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/brightness
```

#### Mute Button LED Control

The mute button LED is **automatically synchronized** with your system's mute state (polls every 200ms). When you mute audio, the LED turns on; when unmuted, it turns off.

**For HDA/ALSA audio devices:**
The driver automatically monitors ALSA controls (Master, Speaker, Headphone, PCM) and syncs the LED.

**For PipeWire/Bluetooth devices:**
If you're using PipeWire or Bluetooth headphones, the mute monitor service is installed and enabled automatically.

**Check service status:**
```bash
# Check if service is running
systemctl --user status omen-mute-monitor.service

# View service logs
journalctl --user -u omen-mute-monitor.service -f

# Check if service is enabled
systemctl --user is-enabled omen-mute-monitor.service

# Restart service if needed
systemctl --user restart omen-mute-monitor.service
```

The service monitors PipeWire mute state using `wpctl` and notifies the kernel driver via sysfs. It runs as your user (for PipeWire access) and uses sudo only for sysfs writes if needed.

**Manual Control:**
```bash
# Manually turn mute button LED on (disables auto-sync)
echo "1" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/mute_led

# Manually turn mute button LED off
echo "0" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/mute_led

# Set mute state from userspace (for PipeWire/Bluetooth)
echo "1" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/mute_state  # Muted
echo "0" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/mute_state  # Unmuted
```

**Note**: Manual control via `mute_led` disables automatic synchronization until the driver is reloaded.

#### Reading Current Values
```bash
# Check current brightness
cat /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/brightness

# Check current animation mode
cat /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/animation_mode

# Check current animation speed
cat /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/animation_speed

# Check current zone colors
cat /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/zone00
cat /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/zone01
# etc...
```

### Fan control (`/sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/fan/`)

Requires the same HP WMI GUID as RGB; **blacklist `hp_wmi`** if both would load (see above). Fan curves need a WMI path, a valid BIOS fan table, and **`CONFIG_THERMAL`** in your kernel so a thermal zone can be read.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cpu_fan_rpm`, `gpu_fan_rpm` | Read-only RPM (where supported) |
| `max_fan` | `0` / `1` — automatic vs max fans |
| `thermal_profile` | Write `silent`, `normal`, or `performance` (WMI preset); read maps EC where possible |
| `fan_curve` | Read/write the active curve (see **Fan curve format** below) |
| `fan_curve_enable` | `0` stops the curve worker; `1` starts it (uses current `fan_curve` points) |
| `fan_temp_zone` | Optional thermal zone name (e.g. `x86_pkg_temp`); if unset, the driver tries common zone names |

After a successful `thermal_profile` write, built-in preset curves are copied into `fan_curve` and the worker starts automatically unless you previously set `fan_curve_enable` to `0` (manual off). Enabling **max fan** disables the curve path. Custom points overwrite `fan_curve`; switching `thermal_profile` again replaces them with that preset’s built-in steps.

With udev rules installed, users in the `input` group can use `tee` on these files without `sudo`, same as RGB.

#### Fan curve format

Curves are **space-separated** pairs:

**`temperature_C:fan_percent`**

- **Temperature:** degrees Celsius from the selected thermal zone (typically CPU package).
- **Fan percent:** `0`–`100`, mapped by the driver into the EC’s allowed fan range using the BIOS fan table.

You need **at least 2** points and may use **up to 8** points per curve. Order does not matter; the driver sorts by temperature. Between two adjacent points the driver **linearly interpolates** fan percent vs temperature; below the lowest point it clamps to that point’s percent, and above the highest it clamps to the last point’s percent.

Example (seven steps):

```bash
F=/sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/fan
echo "30:20 40:28 50:38 60:50 72:65 82:78 92:90" | tee "$F/fan_curve"
echo 1 | tee "$F/fan_curve_enable"
```

Built-in silent / normal / performance presets use five points each; your custom curve can use any count from 2 to 8.

### Color Format

Colors are specified in RGB hex format:
- `FF0000` = Red
- `00FF00` = Green
- `0000FF` = Blue
- `FFFFFF` = White
- `000000` = Black (off)

### Brightness Range

Brightness is specified as a percentage (0-100):
- `0` = Completely off
- `50` = 50% brightness
- `100` = Maximum brightness

### Animation Modes

The driver supports 11 different animation modes:

**Basic Modes:**
- **static** - No animation, static colors (default)
- **breathing** - Smooth breathing effect that fades in and out
- **rainbow** - Rainbow wave that cycles through all colors
- **wave** - Wave effect that moves across the zones
- **pulse** - Pulsing effect with varying intensity

**Advanced Modes:**
- **chase** - Lights follow each other in sequence across zones
- **sparkle** - Random sparkle effect with bright white flashes
- **candle** - Warm flickering candle effect with orange/red colors
- **aurora** - Aurora borealis effect with flowing green/blue waves
- **disco** - Disco strobe effect with bright multi-colored flashes
- **gradient** - Custom color cycling with per-zone-group configuration

### Animation Speed

Animation speed is controlled by a value from 1-10:
- `1` = Slowest animation
- `5` = Default speed
- `10` = Fastest animation

echo "5" | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/animation_speed
```

## Omen Key Mapping

The driver intercepts the Omen key press and maps it to `KEY_MSDOS`, allowing you to bind custom shortcuts to it.

### Setting Up Shortcuts

**GNOME:**
1. Open Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts
2. Click "+" to add a custom shortcut
3. Press the Omen key when prompted
4. Assign your desired action

**KDE Plasma:**
1. System Settings → Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts
2. Edit → New → Global Shortcut → Command/URL
3. Set the trigger to the Omen key
4. Assign your command

**i3/Sway:**
Add to your config file:
```
bindsym XF86DOS exec your-command-here
```

### Customizing the Key Mapping

If you want to map the Omen key to a different key, edit `src/wmi/omen_wmi.c`:

```c
static const struct key_entry hp_wmi_keymap[] = {
    { KE_KEY, OMEN_KEY_SCANCODE, { KEY_MSDOS } },  // Change KEY_MSDOS to your preferred key
    { KE_END, 0 }
};
```

After changing, rebuild with `sudo make install`.

## Troubleshooting

### Module Not Loading
```bash
# Check if WMI is supported
sudo dmesg | grep -i wmi

# Check for errors
sudo dmesg | grep -i omen_rgb_keyboard
```

### No RGB Zones Found
```bash
# Verify the module loaded
lsmod | grep omen_rgb_keyboard

# Check sysfs path
ls -la /sys/devices/platform/omen-rgb-keyboard/rgb_zones/
```

### Colors Not Changing
- Ensure you're using the correct hex format (6 characters, uppercase)
- Check that brightness is not set to 0
- Verify the module loaded without errors

### Secure Boot (Key was rejected by service)
If your Linux distribution enforces strict Secure Boot policies, the kernel will block unsigned drivers from loading, throwing an error like: `modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'omen_rgb_keyboard': Key was rejected by service`.

To resolve this, you must sign the kernel module using a trusted Machine Owner Key (MOK) so your UEFI firmware allows it to load.

* **If you already have existing keys** (you may already have a MOK/key pair, common if you previously set up Secure Boot module signing, e.g. for NVIDIA drivers): Configure DKMS to use your existing private key and public certificate before running `dkms install`.
* **If you do not have a MOK**: You will need to generate a key pair, enroll it in your firmware via `mokutil`, and script DKMS to use it.

For instructions and automated scripts to handle MOK generation and DKMS signing, see the [Community DKMS Signing Guide](https://gist.github.com/sbueringer/bd8cec239c44d66967cf307d808f10c4) or the [Arch Wiki DKMS Documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support#Secure_Boot).
